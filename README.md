# SyntaxEngine
Rule-based syntax engine

This is an exponential time rule-based syntax engine. It's only useful for parsing short natural language sentences. Don't try to use it for C++ source files with thousands lines of code - the engine would just die trying to parse them.

It supports ambiguity, left recursion and more or less natural syntax of rules.
